## 📖 How It Works
1. **Signup/Login:**  
   Users can register or log in. The system checks if a user already exists before creating a new one.

2. **Product Display:**  
   Products are fetched from a mock API and rendered dynamically in categorized sections on the homepage.

3. **Cart Functionality:**  
   Users can add or remove products, update quantities, and view their total including shipping charges — all updated in real-time.
